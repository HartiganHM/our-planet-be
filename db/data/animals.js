  name: 'Arctic Fox',
  status: 'Least Concern',
  population: 'Several Hundred Thousand',
  scientific_name: 'Vulpes lagopus',
  height: '11 inches',
  weight: '3 to 20 pounds',
  length: '18 to 27 inches',
  habitat: 'Antarctica / Artic',
  facts: 'The Arctic fox is primarily a carnivore that lives inland, away from the coasts. They are dependent on the presence of smaller animals (most often lemmings) to survive.  Arctic foxes also hunt for sea birds, fish, and other marine life. Smaller rodent populations waver between times of abundance and scarcity, which leaves the Arctic fox vulnerable when these creatures are low in numbers.',
  human_benefit: 'The protection of the Arctic fox ensures the safety of a variety of other wildlife in the Arctic region.'

  scientific_name: 'Vulpes lagopus',
  height: '',
  weight: '70 to 175 pounds',
  length: '3.2 to 5.9 feet',
  habitat: 'Antarctica / Artic',
  facts: 'Often called the "polar wolf" or "white wolf," Arctic wolves inhabit the Arctic regions of North America and Greenland. Thanks to its isolation, the Arctic wolf is not threatened by hunting and habitat destruction in the same way as its southern relatives.',
  human_benefit: 'Arctic wolves are carnivorous hunters. By nature they help to control the populations of other animals in the region like the musk ox, caribou and Arctic hares.'

  name: 'Bowhead Whale',
  status: 'Least Concern',
  population: 'Approximately 10,000',
  scientific_name: 'Balaena mysticetus',
  height: '',
  weight: '75-100 tons',
  length: 'Average of 50 - 60 feet',
  habitat: 'Oceans',
  facts: 'This predominantly Arctic species is associated with ice floes. Its movement patterns are therefore influenced by the melting and freezing of the ice.\n\nBowhead whales are capable of breaking through sea ice at least seven inches thick with their large skulls and powerful bodies.\n\nAdult bowheads are entirely black except the front part of the lower jaw which is white and prominently upturned. They can grow up to 60 feet long while still being able to leap entirely out of water. Bowheads filter their food through baleen by opening their mouths and straining plankton from the surface, the water column, or the sea floor.\n\nData has shown that bowhead whales may be among the longest-lived animals on earth. Based on the recovery of stone harpoon tips in their blubber, and from analysis of eye tissue, scientists believe that the life-span of bowhead whales can be over 200 years.',
  human_benefit: 'Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. The bowhead whale’s conservation status is listed as “least concern” overall, but some populations (such as near Greenland) are endangered. They have traditionally been hunted by commercial whalers until the last century for oil, meat, and baleen.  Today, native communities in both the U.S. and Russia hunt bowheads for subsistence purposes. This subsistence whaling is approved and its sustainability is ensured by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).'

  name: 'Brown Bear',
  status: 'Least Concern',
  population: 'Over 200,000',
  scientific_name: 'Ursus arctos',
  height: '3.35 feet to shoulders',
  weight: 'Up to 1,500 lbs',
  length: '6.5 feet',
  habitat: 'Antarctica / Artic',
  facts: 'Few animals have captured the imagination like brown bears. They can stand on two legs, walk on the soles of their feet, pick things up with their “fingers,” and often eat what we eat. This—coupled with their ability to communicate with one another through scratch marks left on trees, smells and sounds— establishes a similarity to our own way of life. Some of the largest living carnivores, brown bears have fallen prey to hunting and other conflicts with humans.',
  human_benefit: 'While brown bear population numbers are currently stable, they are considered a high priority in conservation. Given their dependence on large natural areas, brown bears are important management indicators for a number of other wildlife species. Brown bears also play important roles as predators who keep other animal populations in check. Additionally, they act as seed dispersers, helping to sustain their own environment.'

  scientific_name: 'Eschrichtius robustus',
  height: '',
  weight: '',
  length: 'between 40 and 50 feet long',
  habitat: 'Oceans',
  facts: 'Gray whales have a hump and a ridge of sharp bumps along their backs, instead of a dorsal fin. They are a type of baleen whale, which means they filter food from the water through special bristly structures in their mouths. Gray whales stay close to shore and feed in shallow water. Their well-known migrations take them between feeding and breeding areas, swimming as much as 12,000 miles round trip.\n\n Critically endangered western gray whales migrate into their summer feeding grounds near Sahkalin Island, Russia in late May or early June and return to their winter feeding grounds in the South China Sea in late autumn. Summer feeding grounds for the eastern population lie in the Bering and Chukchi Seas between Alaska and Russia. In the winter, these eastern gray whales migrate south along the west coast of the U.S to Mexico to breed and have their calves.',
  human_benefit: 'Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. They are also highly vulnerable to human activities in the ocean.'

  facts: 'The Amazonian rain forest is a bird lover\'s paradise, home to over a thousand different species, including the blue-and-yellow macaw. Macaws are highly intelligent, mate for life and can live up to 60 years. The vibrant color and pattern of their feathers make them a popular species in the illegal pet trade, which has devastated populations of wild exotic birds.',

  length: '39-59 inches',
  habitat: 'North America',
  facts: 'The pronghorn antelope is the fastest hoofed animal in North America and is capable of reaching speeds up to 60 mph. Most pronghorn populations remain stable, but have experienced a historic decline. Pronghorn follow the same migration corridors year after year, generation after generation. Today, the thoroughfares that link the summer breeding grounds and winter grazing areas are being fragmented by roads, cities, fences and energy development. These fragmentations threaten the migratory routes and survival of pronghorn.',
  human_benefit: 'Pronghorn are an indicator of healthy sagebrush systems which can suffer from fragmentation and degradation. They are North America’s fastest land mammal and embark on the longest land migration of any hoofed animal in America’s lower 48 states.'

  habitat: 'Oceans',
  facts: 'Skipjack are the smallest and most abundant of the major commercial tuna species. They have a streamlined body that is mostly without scales. Their backs are dark purple-blue and their lower sides and bellies are silver with four to six dark bands. Skipjack can live as long as 8-10 years. They are found mainly in the tropical areas of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the greatest abundance seen near the equator. Skipjack usually swim near the surface at night and can dive up to 850 feet during the day. Large schools of adult skipjack tuna often mix with juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna.',
  human_benefit: 'Skipjack are commercially important as the main species of canned tuna. Although tuna do provide food and livelihoods for people, they are more than just seafood. Tuna are a top predator in the marine food chain, maintaining a balance in the ocean environment.'

  population: '',
  scientific_name: 'Vulpes velox',
  height: '12 inches',
  weight: '5-7 pounds',
  length: '23-34 inches',
  habitat: 'North America',
  facts: 'Although historically common and widely distributed in short- and mixed-grass prairies of the Great Plains, swift foxes have experienced significant population declines and are now estimated to occupy less than half of their historic range in the United States. In the face of this enormous decline, a multi-stakeholder, comprehensive approach is required to restore swift fox populations across the Northern Great Plains and beyond. Collaboration among tribal communities, universities, conservation organizations, state and government agencies, and private landowners is essential for the swift fox to make a viable comeback.',
  human_benefit: 'Where present, swift foxes are indicators an intact grassland ecosystem. Conserving habitat for and populations of swift foxes benefits other wildlife species that share similar habitat, such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and grassland birds.'

  height: '',
  weight: 'Up to 32 pounds',
  length: '16 to 30 inches, tail length additional 16 to 34 inches',
  habitat: 'Australia',
  facts: 'The same factors that threaten the golden-mantled tree kangaroo also put many of the 13 other tree kangaroo species at risk. Many tree kangaroo species are incredibly rare and most are decreasing in number. These animals represent an interesting divergence in the evolution of Macropods—the family of marsupials that includes kangaroos and wallabies. Macropods were once all tree dwellers but millions of years ago they descended from the trees to live on the ground. The ancestors of tree kangaroos eventually headed back up into the foliage and they are now the largest tree-dwelling mammals in Australia.\n\nTree kangaroos live in lowland and mountainous rainforests in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the far north of Queensland, Australia. They have adapted to life in the trees, with shorter legs and stronger forelimbs for climbing, giving them somewhat of the appearance of a cross between a kangaroo and a lemur.',
  human_benefit: 'Millions of years ago the ancestors of Macropods—the family of marsupials that includes kangaroos and wallabies—descended from the trees. But one group of Macropods, known as tree kangaroos, eventually returned to that arboreal life.'

  facts: 'Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak. They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales on their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets. Hawksbills are found mainly throughout the world\'s tropical oceans, predominantly in coral reefs. They feed mainly on sponges by using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on the reef, but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.',
